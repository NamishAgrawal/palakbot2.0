# palakbot2.0
a bot to stop people from pinging @everyone on discord apart from other things like custom commands,featured poll and text based games
by setting a limit inspired by a friend named palak who used to spam ping everyone apart from other things,
note: this was made by me as a joke to handle some problems on my server and have fun with my friends,
so if you are going to use this code make sure you do read it and make a lot of changes cause i had to use this on only 1 server so 
i did not bother with making public varibles to change the role id so you would have to put the role ids yourself.
